Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.
The program looks for 'From' lines and takes the second word of those 
lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
Afterthe dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

#CODE:

file = input('Please enter file name: ')
handle = open(file)
data1 = list()
data2 = dict()
for line in handle:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if not line.startswith('From '):
		continue
	line = line.split()
	line = line[1]
	data1.append(line)
for i in data1:
	data2[i] = data2.get(i,0)+1

word = None
max = None

for aa, bb in data2.items():
	if max is None or bb > max:
		word = aa
		max = bb

print(word, max)


#INPUT:
Please enter file name: mb.txt

#OUTPUT:
